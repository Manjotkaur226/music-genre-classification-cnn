# music-genre-classification-cnn
A CNN-based music genre classification model using the GTZAN dataset and Mel spectrogram features.
## Project Description

This project implements a music genre classification system using both deep learning (CNN) and traditional machine learning models. The goal is to classify audio spectrogram images into 10 music genres. The system involves data preprocessing, feature extraction using HOG, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment of an interactive web application for prediction.
